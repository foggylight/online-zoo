                p.accordion__text A total of 60 giant panda cubs were born in 2019, bringing the total population of these animals in captivity around the world to 600. And in the wild there are less than 2,000 giant pandas left. They mainly live in Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces. This animal is not only a symbol of the Celestial Empire, but is also under the protection of the Chinese authorities. Harming a panda is punished very severely.

                h4.accordion__title Nutrition
                p.accordion__text The giant panda is a unique predator. Her digestion was originally focused on animal feed. But - millions of years have passed in the process of evolution, digestion has adapted to the digestion of bamboo. The exact reason is unknown. Most likely - there were few animals around that could be caught. And the plant won't run away. Despite the 99% bamboo diet, pandas extract only 17% of the nutrients from it. This is too little. Therefore, these bears must constantly eat. The rest of the time is sleep and rest to save energy.
                p.accordion__text The food process is perfected by pandas. Optimal seated position, freeing the front legs - to take more bamboo. On the paws there are special skin pads and a false thumb - to hold food more tightly. Strong jaws and complex intestinal microflora - to better digest bamboo. He has no chance. In fairness - giant pandas, on occasion, can eat fish, honey, eggs, leaves, fruits, roots and even small animals. But bamboo is somehow easier. More familiar.
